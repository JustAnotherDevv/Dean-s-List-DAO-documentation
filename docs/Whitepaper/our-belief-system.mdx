## Core Beliefs

The following core beliefs for decentralized communities drive our ethos as we evolve from a Service DAO to a Digital Network State:

• Initial distribution is when a community will achieve its highest quorum.

•The quorum a community can achieve is correlated to the amount of speculation in the community’s token. The lower the quorum, the higher the market speculation.

•A governance token should be used for voting, not for speculation. Why hold a governance token if you aren't voting?

•The speed at which a community can grow is correlated to its proposal time. If discussion happens on a daily basis, decision making can happen on a daily basis.

•Participation in voting is correlated to an individual’s contribution in a community.

•A community’s health can be judged by looking at 3 core metrics. What brings value to the community (i.e. more members, more money, more mission), what extracts value from the community (how do we spend our time and money), and what is discussed in the community (what are we focused on, what do we talk about).

•A community needs a clear vision that connects those 3 core metrics (i.e. what brings value is connected to what extracts value and is connected to what is focused on).

•Rewards for contribution need to be rapid and clear; the longer it takes to settle the past, the more the confusion and disappointment from the contributor.

•Work in a community can become a centralized risk to a community if a task is not available to multiple participants; the work being finished is extremely different from having volunteers for the work.

•The vocal minority can create the illusion of disagreement. The ultimate measure of agreement is voting.

•Disputed proposals and failed proposals are healthy. Constant, unanimous, successful proposals are unhealthy.
