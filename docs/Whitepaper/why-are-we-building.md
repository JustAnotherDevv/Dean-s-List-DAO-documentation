# Why Are We Building a Digital Network State?

## Service Providers

The term “service provider” has become an acronym for exploitation in our day and age. Centralized intermediaries in Web2 continue to dish
out unfair treatment to service providers in the form of limited incentives & high participation fees. Divided & conquered, the colonization
continues. Unfortunately, the friction & regulatory environment precludes creation of networking companies to give strength in numbers
under the Web2 umbrella. The lack of tooling to make these structures work in a transparent manner creates mutual distrust. The end result
is that service providers remain divided and encourage their own exploitation at the hands of Web2 companies.

## Our Vision

We believe that the answer to all these problems lies in building a digital network state as a bolder & global collaborative to end exploitation
of service providers. To this end, we have placed our faith in the lightning fast and low cost blockchain architecture of Solana together with a
host of available options on DAO tooling, as the territorial base of our state. This permits us to have a global outreach united by a shared
vision & mutual trust: a state without borders. United in our vision, we have chosen feedback as the signature export of our digital network
state. It is no secret that feedback as a service creates value for the project receiving it but in our experience, this is assumed to be a
free lunch or is paid for in a pittance. We aim to change this by not only monetizing feedback as a service for our citizens but also
providing a template for other potential digital network states to follow our example for other services.
