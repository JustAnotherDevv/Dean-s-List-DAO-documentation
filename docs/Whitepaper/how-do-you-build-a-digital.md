# How Do You Build A Digital Network State?

The American playwright, Tennessee Williams, once wrote about the human condition as:

_"It is a lonely idea, a lonely condition, so terrifying to think of that we usually don't. And so we talk to each other, write and wire each other, call each other short and long distance across land and sea, clasp hands with each other at meeting and at parting, fight each other and even destroy each other because of this always somewhat thwarted effort to break through walls to each other. As a character in a play once said, "We're all of us sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins."_

## The Essence Of A Network State

The essence of what Williams says here is that human beings are lonely and seek social interaction. This urge for interaction has formed the basis of our evolution into a civilized race residing in villages, towns, cities & countries.

**Let us look at this from another viewpoint:**

The earliest reported human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist dated between the 11th and 7th millennium BCE. Had there been no urge for social interaction, there would have been no city state of Athens, modern day Greece and an affinity to affiliate one as European. All those centuries ago, the caveman walked out and interacted which is how we evolved into what we are today.

It is this urge for interaction that has been the precursor to the growth of social media networks in today's digital age. These Web2 companies have harnessed man's historical urge to socialize & built networks that enable this. Come to think of it, but, in January 2023, Facebook reported 2.9bn of monthly active users. If they were a state, by population, they would be the largest.

Having established social interaction as a base human condition, we take inspiration from Balaji Sirivansan, the famed crypto philosopher who has proposed a reverse anthropology as to how digital network states may be built. While the caveman had to step out and interact, Balaji proposes harnessing the opportunities afforded by digital networking to first develop social interaction through digital networks and then transpose this to physical territories.
