# What is the Dean's List DAO?

## THE DECLARATION

Dean's list DAO is building a Digital Network State with a vision to provide prosperity & opportunity to its citizens while building templates for the future of decentralized work & collaboration. We pride ourselves as being the first â€œService DAO'' on Solana. What started off as a Service DAO is now transforming into a network state.

Our aim is to foster an environment of aligned goals in order to create value on-chain in the form of service oriented products that our citizens are skilled in. We call this value our gross domestic product or GDP which is for the benefit of the state's treasury and its citizens. We are leveraging the power of governance protocols and DAO tooling on the Solana network in order to create layers of collaboration within a DAO structure. This allows us to plan, create and sell services to the wider Web3 ecosystem & beyond.
