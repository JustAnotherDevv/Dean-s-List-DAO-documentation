# From Digital to Physical

:::warning

This section content contain information from original Whitepaper whichc might not be fully up to date because of the DAO changes.

:::

To expand to embassies & complete the reverse anthropology of going from a digital network state to a physical one, our plan is to initially run IRL workshops throughout the world focused on educating locals on how to make their first wallet and interact with dApps on Solana. These workshops will help bring in new citizens and also be a point of marketing for our services to Web2 businesses. Using a standard template will allow multiple workshops to happen across the globe.

Once our treasury has grown & reached a sustainable level, we will be able to establish our first embassy, a permanent location for running workshops related to our services and selling merchandise related to our brand. Over time, these embassies will be expanded to give our state a global presence.
