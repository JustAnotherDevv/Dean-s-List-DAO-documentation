# DecentraGrants

## Grant Specifics:

Dean’s List will oversee the deployment of $50,000 USDC to inbound grants focused on public goods and open source tooling for DAOs, Governance, and Decentralized Communities.

Dean’s List will allocate grants for inbound submissions in 2 ways:

- Bi-monthly workshops. During these workshops, grantees will present their ideas and existing grantees will share their milestone updates.After each workshop, for grants that we define as top quality, we will vote on which ones we will accept into our grants program.
- Quadratic funding round. We will use Stockpile to allow the entire ecosystem a chance to help us decide which grants to accept

Dean’s List will receive $10,000 for successfully completing this distribution.

**Payout Pool Potential: $5850** (this is after the tax and sales referral fee have been deducted already).

**This payout is what is available for the manager and team that will oversee**

- The creation and maintenance of the CRM. This includes making the application process for potential grants, the invite process for the bi-weekly workshops, the hosting of the workshops, and updating the spreadsheet of all grants received and their status
- Participation in the bi-monthly roundtable (DeanMachine will likely also help on this but will not be the dedicated point person)
- Marketing the program to the entire Solana ecosystem and working with partners to get more submissions. Tweeting is one example of marketing. Posting ideas on Superteam Build is an example of working with partners.
- Coordinating grants program with our Quadratic Funding partner, Stockpile
- Updating the Solana Foundation monthly updates spreadsheet([here is an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNpRIE6gTSPdyffvE9Vk-efmSZkqnr7U3dqmEfRONjc/edit#gid=0))
- Coordinating the onchain votes and payments to grantees along with the milestones.
