# Operational Framework Intro

## Community Operations

Becoming Dean's List DAO citizen or acquiring Business Visa allows for participation in certain activities within the DAO, such as:

- Feedback Sessions
- Tokenomics Review
- Technical Writing(Case Studies)

### Feedback Sessions

Feedback will be conducted exclusively on the [Dash](https://dash.deanslist.services) once itâ€™s undergone the last few modifications in order to ensure a smooth feedback experience for everyone involved. For now it is conducted through forum-intro posts in the [DL Onboarding Server](https://discord.gg/5j2FHKAXGh).

#### Rules

- Participation in each session is 5k $DEAN (~$4.50 at current price), which no longer needs to be deposited up front, as it is now deducted from the final payouts instead!

- Workshop attendance & participation is a must for payouts. For this purpose, each participant will have to share one point of feedback with the client team and take their view on it on call.

- All feedback should be accompanied with media and cannot be generalized comments.

#### Feedback Grading

- **"0"** for repetitions / invalid / incomplete points
- **"1"** for Valid Points
- **"2"** for Feedback that comes with proof of on chain transactions

### Technical Writing

Occasionally Dean's List might organize internal contest for writing related to the DAO itself, its services or case studies from previous clients.

**Selection process:**

- **1)** @Signer receiving submissions and doing quality check
- **2)** Final 2 (or 3?) submissions get shortlisted; Final number of shortlists will be defined by the quality of applications.
- **3)** The DAO votes on one winner for these shortlist.

**Eligibility:** Open to EVERYONE

**Participation cost/entry fee:**
$100 in $DEAN.

**Deadline:** Additionally, each writing contest contains a deadline for paying entry fee and deadline for submission of writing.
