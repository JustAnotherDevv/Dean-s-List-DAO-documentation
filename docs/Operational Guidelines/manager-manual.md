# Manager Manual V 1.0

## What is a Manager in Dean’s List?

In the Dean’s List DAO, there are two distinct Manager roles. One oversees customer projects, ensuring timely and qualitative product delivery. The other plans and executes operations for our internal departments, optimizing organizational efficiency. Both roles are pivotal, one focused on client satisfaction and the other on internal processes for seamless operations.

For better role distinction, here are the major types of management positions in Dean’s List DAO:

- Project Management
- Departmental Management

## How does one become a Project Manager?

**Context:**

> When our DAO sells a service, like our Feedback Service, it is expected to produce an output. In such sales, a 35% tax is applied to support the DAO’s operations and initiatives. After deducting this, a portion is allocated to the salesperson, with the remainder used to reward the service's fulfillment.

After a sale, the operations department announces open submissions for Management where NFT-holding citizens can propose budget plans, processes, and deliverables. Two days after the announcement, aspiring managers present their proposals to fellow citizens in a call. Following the pitches, NFT-holding call participants vote to choose the manager. This democratic process ensures active community involvement and transparency in decision-making within the DAO.

## What are the Project Manager’s responsibilities?

- The Project Manager is responsible for communicating with the client to identify further customer needs and potentially collect information that might be necessary.
- The Project Manager is responsible for the product’s delivery and quality.
- The Project Manager is responsible for allocating the budget.

## How does one become a Department Manager?

**Context:**

> Departmental costs are covered by the DAO’s revenue. The budget of a department is variable.

Aspiring department managers share their proposals with the community on the 1st of each month. After the submission day, the department’s previous manager puts the proposals up for an on-chain vote where the community picks their favorite.

## What are the Department Manager’s responsibilities?

- The Department Manager is responsible for submitting monthly budgets for the operations within the department
- The Department Manager is responsible for running day to day operations within the department.
- The Department Manager is responsible for organizing departmental activities and events should the need arise.
