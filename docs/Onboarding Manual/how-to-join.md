# Our Citizenship Model

Here at Dean's List, we believe that the concept of communities with a large membership base is not only outdated but extremely inefficient. We are guided in our thinking by Dunbar's number which is the theoretical limit to the amount of meaningful societal relationships that one person can maintain. For **Dunbar**, the absolute maximum is 150 but, erring on the side of conservatism, we do not intend to have more than 100 citizens.

# How Can You Join In

Interested in becoming one of us? The Dean's List DAO operates primarily through our Discord server. At present, there are only three ways to join:

- Purchase a **$DEAN** Token from our [Coinable Store](https://coinablepay.com/@deanslist/ozWxnDy7G7B2Mxw2LLia72).
- Purchase one of our **NFTs** on the [secondary market](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/deanslist-) or try your luck at one of our auctions.
- Become a customer by purchasing one of our packages through our [Coinable Store](https://coinablepay.com/@deanslist/ozWxnDy7G7B2Mxw2LLia72).

**NFT holders are the only full citizens of the Dean's List Network State.**

### THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO BECOME A CITIZEN!

We want everyone that joins the DAO to do so through proof of work. As you earn more, you will get closer to becoming _"One of US"_

### Full Citizens enjoy:

- More earning opportunities
- Higher payouts
- Access to all channels
- Voting rights in our DAO operations
- Vesting **$DEAN** tokens
- and more
