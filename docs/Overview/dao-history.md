# History

Since its inception, Dean's List DAO went significant transformations.
This documentation provides an overview of the DAO's journey, highlighting key milestones, lessons learned, and the vision for the future.

## Origins

Dean's List DAO was created as a response to the prevailing challenges faced by decentralized communities,
particularly in terms of different forms of governance, and community engagement. Drawing inspiration from successful projects like [BONK](https://bonkcoin.com/), the DAO aimed to revolutionize token distribution by prioritizing merit and active participation over passive airdrops.

Unlike traditional airdrop models, Dean's List DAO adopted a proactive approach to token distribution. By allowing individuals to earn membership through contributions and engagement prior to the airdrop, the DAO sought to build a highly active and committed community from the outset. This strategy involved transparent selection criteria and clear pathways for participation, both with and without financial investment.

## Lessons Learned

In response to challenges with the existing token infrastructure, Dean's List DAO made the strategic decision to transition to a new token. This move aimed to optimize distribution, remove volatility, and enhance control over membership requirements.

## Forging Ahead

During the first few weeks of 2024 the community made massive progress towards redefining and finalizing some of the governance primitives. Detailed changes are listed on [Tokenomics Page](/docs/Governance%20Framework/tokenomics-intro#tokenomics-changes).
