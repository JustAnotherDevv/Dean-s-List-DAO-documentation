# About Dean's List DAO

![Dean's List](image.png)

The mission of the Dean's List DAO is to build a borderless Digital Network State that provides opportunities to its citizens and changes the future of work.
It aims to create value on-chain through service-oriented products and service provision to the wider Web3 ecosystem and beyond. Currently main product is
feedback service which DAO participants provide their expertise to Solana protocols for ecosystem enhancement and user experience refinement which is available in our [store](https://store.deanslist.services).

The DAO seeks to transcend traditional boundaries and create a global community united by a shared vision and mutual trust.
It aims to export feedback as a valuable service, monetize it for citizens in a model where everyone gains something and
provide a template for other digital network states to follow.
