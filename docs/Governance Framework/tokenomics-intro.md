# Core $DEAN Tokenomics

## Token Information:

- **Token Name:** DEAN
- **Token Symbol:** DEAN
- **Token Type:** SPL Token
- **Total Supply:** 75.000.000 Tokens
- **Mint Authority:** Active

## Token Allocation:

- **Initial Circulating Supply:** 50.000.000 Tokens
- **Reserve Fund:** There is no reserve fund. All tokens are meant to circulate inside the DAO’s economy.
- **Team and Advisors:** There was no special allocation for the core team or advisors.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** 100% of the tokens were allocated to members of the Dean’s List DAO and to the wider Solana Ecosystem through an airdrop.

- Active groups of the Solana Ecosystem received an airdrop in the form of Dual Finance Options with a strike price of 0.00001 USDC per token.

## Token Utility:

- **Use Cases:**  
  **1):** It empowers holders to participate in voting for active proposals via [Realms](https://app.realms.today/dao/Dean's%20List%20Network%20State)  
  **2):** It operates as an internal currency within the DAO, enabling members to engage in various DAO activities.
- **Staking:** Although the DEAN tokens cannot be staked, one can stake their Dean’s List NFT. That will yield stakers 50 DEAN tokens per day.
- **Governance:** Token Holders participate mostly in polling because the DAO keeps the majority of its funds in various multisig wallets managed by reputable members of the community.
- **Burn Mechanism:** No burning mechanism exists. Yet, as users use DEAN tokens to buy-in their participation in various activities, a significant portion flows into the DAO’s treasury, effectively reducing the circulation.

## Roadmap:

- **Development Phases:** The DAO is still debating on whether it’ll not burn the mint authority and keep increasing circulation.
- **Partnerships:** The DAO actively seeks collaborations with ecosystem stakeholders to enhance utility for DEAN token holders.
- **Liquidity Pools:** The DAO does not officially endorse the creation of liquidity pools for trading "DEAN" tokens. However, holders retain the autonomy to create and manage such pools at their discretion.
