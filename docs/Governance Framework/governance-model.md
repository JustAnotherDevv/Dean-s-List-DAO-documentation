# DAO Governance Model

_A governance token should be used for voting, not for speculation. Why hold a governance token if you arent voting!_

## Voting Rules

- We believe that the speed at which a community can grow is correlated to its proposal time. That's why vote time threshold lasts only 24 hours. This allows our citizens to rapidly decide and evolve to new opportunities & challenges.
