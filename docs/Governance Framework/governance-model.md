# DAO Governance Model

Dean's List DAO operates on a unique token model called [Participation Tokens](/docs/Governance%20Framework/tokenomics). These tokens serve as both a means of participation in DAO activities and a governance mechanism.

> _A governance token should be used for voting, not for speculation. Why hold a governance token if you arent voting!_

## Governance Mechanism

Instead of relying solely on token governance, the DAO utilizes a multi-sig reputation-based approach for governance polling. This multi-sig is represented as a council consisting of most active and engaged community members. Community funds are managed across multiple multi-sig wallets, with sentiment voting conducted using $DEAN tokens. Multi-sig owners generally honor the majority and quorum in decision-making.

## Voting Rules

- We believe that the speed at which a community can grow is correlated to its proposal time. That's why vote time threshold lasts only 24 hours. This allows our citizens to rapidly decide and evolve to new opportunities & challenges.
- Min Governance Power to Create a Proposal - `100,000`
- Approval Quorum - `60%`
